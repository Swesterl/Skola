\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}
One of the most fundamental challenges of any company is one that often requires more attention than it receives. It is difficult to grasp, yet it is central to both the processes and the direction of the company. The corporate strategy provides the  foundation  of the business that ties into every action. \\
\newline\noindent
Netlight Consulting provides its clients with tailored IT and management solutions with focus on innovation and business sense. They employ approximately 700 employees and have offices in 8 cities, including Stockholm, Paris, London and Munich (Netlight LinkedIn, 2016). We have delved into their corporate culture and assessed their strategy with the objective of finding improvements from the perspective of strategy maps and balanced scorecards (Kaplan and Norton, 2004). As industrial management students from a computer science background, conducting a study of this nature yields valuable insight into key success factors of Netlight. Furthermore, it is a tremendous opportunity for us to partake in shaping our future workplace. \\
\newline\noindent
The purpose of this study can be divided in two perspectives. The study allows for practical application of theory introduced in the industrial management program, further expanding our understanding of the interaction between corporate strategy and culture. Additionally, there is great appeal for Netlight to get an outside perspective of their company.

\section*{Analysis of Netlight}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Analysis of Netlight}
An essential part of corporate strategy is the company's mission, vision and values (Kaplan and Norton, 2004). These establish clear guidelines for both employees and clients on the company's purpose, where the company is headed and the embodied values of the company. 
\subsection*{Values}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Values}
Netlight has three core values that are at the heart of the company. Their values are \textbf{Competence}, \textbf{Creativity} and \textbf{Business Sense} (Netlight LinkedIn, 2016) which are most of all reflected in the employees that they hire. \\
\newline
Competence is not only reflected in Netlight's recruitment of potential candidates. Perhaps more importantly, it is reflected in their internal processes that ensure that competence grows within the firm. Netlight believes in competence in the form of collective knowledge. Their EDGE program is designed to bring employees together and create an environment where they feel encouraged to share their experience with one another (Netlight LinkedIn, 2016; Interview With Employee at Netlight's Internal Business Development Unit, 2016). Additionally, the corporate culture at Netlight stimulates getting input from employees possessing relevant expertise that are not directly connected to the project. Lastly, all employees at Netlight are equipped with a mentor to coach them in their career. In addition to semi-annual feedback sessions, the mentorship gives employees access to faster feedback which has tremendous impact on individual competence (Interview With Employee at Netlight's Business Development Unit, 2016).\\
\newline
Most companies strive for creativity to varying extents. Netlight believes in individuals but not in individualists (Netlight, 2016). Creativity starts at the individual level and is enhanced at an organizational level to deliver innovative solutions to customers. Furthermore, Netlight realizes one of the key factors to creativity is an open-minded, diverse work force. Their Vostok initiative attempts to attract women into the IT-industry by arranging meet-ups, code pubs and by talking at universities. This gives Netlight the advantage by assuming the role of a familiar face for newly graduated women. \\
\newline
The business sense is essential to the surrounding components of problem solving (Interview With Employee at Netlight's Talent Search, 2016). They don't strive to find the best programmers. Instead, they recruit individuals with a healthy blend of technical competence and business sense that create a good atmosphere when working with customers (Interview With Employee at Netlight's Internal Business Development Unit, 2016). This can be identified as one of the key factors to Netlight's success.
\subsection*{Misson and Vision}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Mission and Vision}


Netlight does not have any outspoken mission or vision. They instead rely heavily on their values, which has been rather effective as evident by their great success and rapid growth. Employees at Netlight has phrased it as:  \newline

\textit{"Values aren't suppose to be some inspiring words painted on the walls, it is supposed to be in the walls."} \newline

With this the employees refers to how values should be a part of everything the company does. As an external party however, it is important to define the company within* these areas in order to be able to provide solutions which align with their company's aspirations. We will therefore propose suitable mission and vision statements based on the inputs we have received. Based on what we were* told during the interviews and what we have gather through their official forums we perceive their mission statement to be the following:\newline


\textit{"To help our clients achieve greatness by incorporating cutting edge technology."} \newline

We find that this concise statement accurately depicts Netlight's purpose and describes their primary function within a broader corporate architecture(this statment is a fucking stretch). Regarding the vision, we noticed that both of our interviewees described how Netlight strived not to deliver consultants to their clients but rather the phenomena that is Netlight. This phenomena was described as an almost magical* entity which would solve all of the clients problems. Our proposition is hence*,\newline

\textit{"To deliver Netlight as an entity and not the individuals we can provide independent solutions, tangible results and sustainable value to our clients through a combination of competence, creativity and business sense."} \newline

Whilst not particularly exciting or inspiring, it servers to provide a sense of what Netlight strives to become.

\subsection*{Strategy}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Strategy}
As a consulting firm, Netlight's strategy type is customer solutions. They rely on returning customers and provide their clients with long-term profitability (Kaplan and Norton, 2004). However, by considering their consultants as products, they fulfill a majority of the criteria of product leadership as well. By incorporating business sense and valuing personality, Netlight can venture into unexplored market segments where technical competence by itself is not adequate. \\
\newline
As aforementioned, one of Netlight's core values is competence. This is somewhat misleading since it implies that the competence is tied to individuals. However, by virtue of knowledge sharing within the organization, Netlight brings the entirety of the firm's competence to each customer. Herein lies the corporate strategy. They invest in the acquiring talented individuals in combination with an open and inclusive corporate culture. This translates to good business relations and solutions where a multitude of perspectives are explored.

\section*{Strategy Map}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Strategy Maps}
The strategy map is a simple approach to get a holistic view of the organization. It incorporates four different perspectives and links them together through cause and effect.

\subsubsection*{Financial Perspective}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Financial Perspective}
At the top of the financial perspective is the \textbf{shareholder value}. In 
order to increase the value that Netlight delivers to their shareholders, the company can either \textbf{increase revenue} or \textbf{decrease costs}. Increasing revenue can be accomplished through \textbf{expanding} into new market segments or geographical locations. Alternatively, Netlight can strive to exploit current market segments to a greater extent. Despite not creating value instantaneously, customer retention is essential as it facilitates the creation of shareholder value in the future.

\subsubsection*{Customer Perspective}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Customer Perspective}
Customer retention is achieved through \textit{genuine consulting} which boils down to maintaining healthy relations with customers. Netlight achieves this by virtue of their three core values: \textbf{competence}, \textbf{creativity} and \textbf{business sense} which is reflected in their recruitment process. These values translate to \textbf{independent solutions} and \textbf{tangible results} of \textbf{significant value} for their customers. Thus, it is imperative to maintain these values when chasing strategic objectives. Thought has to be devoted to both \textit{internal processes} and how the organization \textit{learns and grows}.

\subsection*{Internal Process Perspective}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Internal Process Perspective}
We propose alignment with the following objectives within the internal process perspective.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Streamline administration} - Remove unnecessary administrative tasks (for example HR's invoice tasks) so that employees can focus on their real objectives.
\item \textbf{Improve utilization of consultant's in-house time} - Having tools that make it easy to find consultants between jobs, with relevant expertise, to assist in in-house projects. 
\item \textbf{Education, knowledge sharing and individual improvement} - In order to guarantee cutting edge solutions, Netlight needs to possess cutting edge knowledge. One of the key tools within the company to ensure that knowledge flows between employees is EDGE. EDGE is designed to capture what is important to a client, independent of the technological solutions and deliver it to employees in an inspirational manner. The aim is for the knowledge sharing to become a natural part of the company. The knowledge sharing at Netlight could be improved by two simple measures.
\begin{itemize}
\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
\item Once a year Netlight hosts an EDGE conference to spread awareness of what is valuable. By hosting some smaller events more frequently Netlight can expect higher morale and more formal networking opportunities.
\item Most of the internal networking is currently ad-hoc based presenting problems in a growing organization. We propose developing platforms facilitating networking between employees. This provides the company with means to minimize growing pains as staff reaches critical mass.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Creating and maintaining customer relations} - Improvements can be made on processes to allow for consultants to focus more on the customer. Netlight's culture embraces chaos. However, by tactically incorporating structure into procedures that are repeated between customers, the aforementioned improvements can be made.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Learning \& Growth Perspective}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Learning \& Growth Perspective}
\textbf{Human capital} is the importance of recruiting  and maintaining the right individuals for the firm. This encapsulates reflection regarding which individuals to target in the recruitment process.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Personal networks} - Since Netlight revolves around employee networking, HR should focus on identifying individuals that can communicate their expertise in an understandable manner. Additionally, targeting people with large networks outside of the company provides valuable perspectives as well as a larger talent pool for potential recruitment.
\item \textbf{Self-leadership} - In a consulting firm autonomy is essential. This requires employees that are self-governing and able to promote their ideas. 
\item \textbf{Diversity} - From a recruitment standpoint it is important to show that the company values diversity. By employing and maintaining a diverse workforce the company gains access to new markets segments as well as new ideas.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
\textbf{Information capital} involves efficient handling of information internally, including knowledge bases, business systems and communication platforms.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Accessible knowledge base} - It should be straight forward to contact other employees with relevant expertise to the project. 
\item \textbf{Easy to handle business systems} - Assist in administrative tasks through intuitive internal business systems.
\item \textbf{Customer Database} - In order for the organization to achieve organizational alignment in regards to a product range, a control system of current customers needs to be implemented.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Organizational capital} entails the routines and culture that ensure that the firm can deliver quality services to its customers.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Open minded culture} - Firstly, it is of paramount importance that Netlight engage all of its employees in diversity. Elsewise, they may no longer be one of the premiere workplaces for talented minorites. Secondly, a focus on the importance of keeping to company values when meeting clients while still being open. Thirdly, maintaining an atmosphere in which each worker feels comfortable in disagreeing, even on important matters. McKinsey \& Company refers to this as the \textit{obligation to dissent} which helps exhaust all ideas in discussions. The obligation of dissent requires all employees to speak up when they disagree or if presented solutions go against corporate values (McKinsey, 2016). 
\item \textbf{No managers} - In order for employees to be productive they need to feel personal accountability for the product they are developing (Interview With Employee at Netlight's Talent Search, 2016; Thompson, 2004). Therefore, Netlight utilizes a flat hierarchy where managers are replaced with coaches, called \textit{solution managers}.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Strategic Themes}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Strategic Themes}
In this section we evaluate two different strategic themes in the strategy map (Kaplan and Norton, 2004). A strategic theme can be seen as a flow of cause and effect events that permeate through all four perspectives that were introduced in the previous section. Looking at the lowest level of the strategy map, namely the learning \& growth perspective, we have listed three strategic objectives.

\subsection*{Theme 1: Increase Efficiency of Internal Operations}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Increase Efficiency of Internal Operations}



This strategic theme aims for creating an improved cost structure which in long term can increase Netlight’s profit margins and enable them to invest more into becoming even better and keep growing. Netlight has a department called Compliance, which are working with all departments within Netlight to find bottlenecks, and improve processes (Interview With Employee at Netlight's Business Development Unit, 2016).
\subsubsection*{Financial Perspective}
In the financial perspective we have the objective to improve cost structure. One way to measure the cost structure in a consultant business like Netlight is to measure cost per consultant. Furthermore, if this is measured per department, Netlight can understand where the biggest issues lies when growing in such a fast pace as they currently do. Focusing on streamlining operations related to the department that has the highest cost per consultant will prepare them for future growth.
\subsubsection*{Customer Perspective}
In this strategic theme, the customer perspective is not highly considered. This theme focus on internal efficiency, which does not concern the customer too much since Netlight are not aiming for decreasing the price to the customer. One could argue that efficient internal operations could keep customers satisfied with the cooperation with Netlight and in turn contribute to increased customer value. However, Netlight’s strategy aims to create customer value in other ways than efficient internal operations, it would just be a bonus.
\subsubsection*{Internal Process Perspective}
Administration, like payroll, invoicing and other HR administrative processes is something Netlight needs to have streamlined. When growing in such a pace, it will be costly if these processes are not semi-automated. The connection to an improved cost structure through streamlining processes is trivial. By defining standard processes and templates, Netlight can measure that standards are followed and raw data are homogenous in the way that they have the exact same structure. This will make it possible to automate some processes and reach an efficient administration.

Since Netlight is a consultant business, they sell their human capital to other companies. This is highly valuable to their customers and when consultants does not work on a customer project, their time can be valuable to Netlight as well. Netlight have internal projects that needs human resources as well, which means that if they can utilize the time when consultants are in the office, they can decrease the costs of internal projects and thereby improve the cost structure. 

\subsubsection*{Learning \& Growth Perspective}
Having easy to handle business system will logically increase the efficiency of utilizing Netlight employees. Developing a suitable and qualitative system is however an iterating process and followups must be made to ensure a best-practice implementation, which consequently will lead to a higher employee satisfaction. In addition, making use of the Compliance department when developing such a system is an optimal use of company resources. Moreover, a suggested target would be 90 percent employee satisfaction and can be measured through initiatives such as employee surveys.

\hspace*{5pt}\includepdf[landscape=true]{BalancedScorecard3}

\subsection*{Theme 2: Customer Value}

This strategy theme’s purpose is to invigorate a sustainable competitive advantage and consequently provide customer value. Netlight has an embedded notion of providing tailored customer solutions, however, in order to maintain a high quality end product Netlight needs continuous improvements. The initiatives proposed in balance scorecard 1 will help Netlight to achieve this. 
\subsubsection*{Financial Perspective}
It was mentioned earlier that the objective to have a high customer retention rate indirectly contributes to long term revenue growth. By tracking retention rates, Netlight can be aware of their situation. Additionally, having key account managers or a similar role who has the responsibility to maintain a good relation with the customer will help them to achieve high retention rate and customer satisfaction.
\subsubsection*{Customer Perspective}
The first objective, independent / custom made solutions will be achieved by adapting to the customers’ needs. This might be trivial for a consultant business like Netlight. However, the agile framework can help them reach this goal in a effective and structured process. 
\newline\newline
To create tangible solutions, which is the next objective, it is important that Netlight can prove or show what actually has been done. This can be measured by incorporating an explicit section in handover documentation in the end of a project. It is unclear from our sources and interviews if Netlight is already doing this or other initiatives to ensure their delivery of tangible solutions. 
\newline\newline
To ensure the delivery of sustainable solutions, the Balanced Scorecard suggest that Netlight can conduct long-term follow ups with their customers. The results can later also be used as marketing material. Other initiatives to maintain sustainable solutions are peer reviews and testing of frameworks or products that Netlight develop. Netlight consultants reaches a better quality of their work by using their network (Interview With Employee at Netlight's Talent Search, 2016). 
\newline\newline
To reach these three objectives, Netlight focus on their three values: Competence, Creativity and Business sense. The strategy is to align the employees to these values and make them live by them (Interview With Employee at Netlight's Talent Search,2016; Interview With Employee at Netlight's Internal Business Development Unit, 2016). If this would be measured, Netlight could perform employee surveys. However, since they are continuously working with these values, the employees are well aware of the values and how they work to improve on them (Interview With Employee at Netlight's Talent Search,2016; Interview With Employee at Netlight's Internal Business Development Unit, 2016).
\subsubsection*{Internal Process Perspective}
Education, knowledge sharing and individual improvement is one of Netlight’s most important objectives. All initiatives for this objective in the balance scorecard already exist at Netlight. The Edge initiative includes both formal and informal knowledge sharing sessions. Their semi-annual review process helps individual improvements and education is provided for the employees through other initiatives. By arranging occasions Netlight can be assured that improvement will happen, and through trust of the human capital and the culture, more informal occasions will emerge if employees are given the opportunity (Interview With Employee at Netlight's Internal Business Development Unit, 2016).
\newline\newline
Netlight has several initiatives to align to the objective of maintaining employee morale and motivation. Recognizing achievements and celebrating success keeps motivation up and through feedback sessions the morale can be controlled. It can be challenging to measure morale and motivation but it can for example be done to some extent through employee surveys.
\newline\newline
By making internal networking easy, learning and knowledge sharing will be improved as well. Initiatives like destination unknown, where all Netlight employees go to an unknown destination for a conference every spring. The measure would be the number of occasions of these get togethers.
\subsubsection*{Learning \& Growth Perspective}
For Netlight to be able to learn and grow as an IT company, it is critical to be visible among potential employees at an early stage. This means, among other things, to partake and promote the modernisation of the IT education. Such an approach would potentially create an image of a company that genuinely wants to get involved in the IT business on every level.
\newline\newline
Besides being an innovative company in the tech business, a company should not neglect to be innovative in other areas such as recruitment. Thinking long-term, a relative simple act such as Netlight being present on the graduation of high-school students could potentially make a difference (Interview With Employee at Netlight's Talent Search,2016).
\newline\newline
Moving on to a more functional analysis, it has been mentioned that knowledge sharing is an essential factor for Netlight’s operations. It’s a positive initiative from Netlight that there is a Solution manager in every team that acts as a coach with experience on matters that is in need of guidance. Nevertheless, it needs to be taken into account that facilitating the individual work progress could potentially increase the effectiveness of the communication between senior staff and the customer. Codification is a tool that should be considered. Generalizing common issues and aspects when dealing with Netlight customers would make it easier to formulate a problem statement. Having such a system means also training company employees in communications standards.
\newline\newline
Lastly, consolidating a change in an organization, which includes promoting a desirable behaviour among employees, roles models could help pave the way. However, it’s important to realize that diversity is a factor that needs attention. A Netlight employee needs to understand why certain things are used and why it’s important. Therefore, an employee that identifies itself with a senior staff would ease the indoctrination of junior employees and consequently achieve the desirable feature of self-leadership, i.e. autonomously working employees/teams.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Customer Value}
\hspace*{5pt}\includepdf[landscape=true]{BalanceScorecard2}

\newpage
\section*{Discussion and Conclusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Discussion}
Despite not having explicit mission and vision statements, Netlight are experiencing a surprising amount of success. Their three values; Competence, Creativity and Business Sense, are driving the company towards growth and prosperity. In combination with the open-minded culture, flat hierarchy and self-governing employees, Netlight has expanded tremendously during the past decade. The interviews that were conducted as a basis for this study, yielded that Netlight is intent on expanding their business further. Therefore, Netlight needs to devote thought to how tools and processes translate on a larger scale. One aspect, illustrated in the strategy map and balance scorecards, is to include some form of codification or semi-structured knowledge bases into operations.
Netlight’s current knowledge sharing methods place all responsibility on the consultants and relies on them to contact other consultants with relevant expertise. Should Netlight grow much bigger, basing all knowledge sharing on personal networking might cause a limitation. 
\newline\newline
In pursuance of establishing a semi-structured knowledge base, it is possible to draw inspiration from McKinsey, a firm of over 10 000 consultants and 2 000 researchers. To facilitate knowledge sharing in a larger company, McKinsey utilizes a network of knowledge professionals with the objective of networking with consultants and mapping knowledge. This allows for optimized knowledge sharing with more procedural structure. The network consists of 1800 employees providing a ratio of one knowledge professional to every 5 consultants (McKinsey, 2016). However, Netlight values networking between consultants and this approach moves away from that. Therefore, we suggest implementing employee classification to aid consultants to network with others that possess relevant expertise. Employees could be classified on their expertise as well as their areas of interests which would be a scalable alternative to ad-hoc networking.
\newline\newline
*detta uppfyller våra themes
*Dessa themesen uppfyller deras mål och drömmar.

In conclusion, we believe that it is paramount for Netlight to adopt a more structured way of networking between consultants if they wish to expand further. However, we do not want to influence the corporate culture in Netlight as we have identified it as one of the key factors to the company’s success. This needs to be taken into account when developing a new networking solution.

* vi tror att denna åtgärd kan hjälpa uppfylla netlights mål.
